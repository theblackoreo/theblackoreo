### 🤖 SAHARA – Secure Ad-Hoc Advanced Resilient Architecture  
_A decentralized reputation-based routing system for mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs)_

📚 Developed as part of my Master’s Thesis at **Florida Atlantic University (FAU, USA)** within the **AI & Autonomous Vehicles Lab**.

SAHARA (Secure Ad-Hoc Advanced Resilient Architecture) is a decentralized system designed to improve **routing decisions, network resilience, and security** in mobile ad-hoc networks with minimal overhead. It is specifically engineered for **resource-constrained environments**, such as autonomous robot and drone swarms.

#### 🔍 Key Concepts Integrated
- 📡 **Routing Protocol Optimization**
- 🔁 **Efficient Information Dissemination**
- 🔐 **Network Integrity & Security**

The system autonomously adapts to dynamic conditions, mitigating attacks while preserving performance and energy efficiency.

#### 🚀 Core Features
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔄 Information Dissemination | SAHARA Sync uses lightweight diffusion to reduce overhead vs. traditional flooding |
| ⭐ Reputation-Based Evaluation | Nodes are assessed on trustworthiness to improve routing decisions |
| 🛡 Resilience to Attacks | Detects and responds to malicious activity (packet drop, DoS) ensuring performance recovery |
| 🤖 Self-Adapting System | Automatically adjusts to changing conditions to improve efficiency & security |
| 🧪 Simulation | Fully simulated using **NS-3** (discrete-event network simulator) |

#### 🛰 Use Case
Ideal for **swarm robotics and drone networks**, where resource efficiency, decentralized decision-making, and security are critical.

💡 Key benefits:
- 📈 Improved **routing robustness** via reputation-based decisions  
- 🔋 Reduced **communication and energy costs**  
- 🔒 Enhanced protection from **internal attacks on network integrity**
