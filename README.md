### [HyperShipBattle_Server](https://github.com/theblackoreo/HyperShipBattle_Server)  
A game fully on-chain: every transaction corresponds to a move, with on-chain token mechanics, and **airdrop rewards for the winning group**. Powered by Solana blockchain.  
- 💡 **Concept** — each move is a blockchain transaction: players battle on-chain, and winners earn token-based rewards.  
- 🛠 **Tech stack** — Solana (smart contracts / on-chain logic), backend server for game orchestration, on-chain token management.  
- 🎯 **Why it matters** — combines gaming and decentralized finance: transparency, provable fairness, and real value transfer via crypto.  

> “A fun, secure, and transparent on-chain gaming experience — where playing is transacting.”
