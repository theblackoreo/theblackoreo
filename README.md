### 🎮 Solana On-Chain Battleship Game  
**🌐 Fully Decentralized • Trustless • Lives Forever on the Blockchain**

- 🔗 **Backend / Server**  
  https://github.com/theblackoreo/HyperShipBattle_Server  

- 🎨 **Frontend Client**  
  https://github.com/theblackoreo/deep-battle-ship  

This project implements a fully on-chain battleship game powered by the **Solana blockchain**, where _every in-game action is represented by a transaction_. Players interact directly with smart contracts, ensuring transparent mechanics and provable fairness.

#### 🧠 Features
- 🔒 Fully On-Chain Logic (no centralized server)
- 🛰 Decentralized State Management
- ⚡ High-performance and low-cost transactions (Solana)
- 🪙 Token-based Rewards System
- 🔁 Each shot is randomly assigned per transaction
- ♾️ Immutable & permanently hosted on-chain

#### 🛠 Tech Stack
| Layer | Technologies |
|------|--------------|
| Blockchain | Solana |
| Smart Contracts | Rust + Anchor |
| Frontend | React |
| Architecture | Fully On-Chain, Token-Enabled |

### 🤖 SAHARA – Secure Ad-Hoc Advanced Resilient Architecture  
_A decentralized reputation-based routing system for mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs)_

📚 Developed as part of my Master’s Thesis at **Florida Atlantic University (FAU, USA)** within the **AI & Autonomous Vehicles Lab**.

SAHARA (Secure Ad-Hoc Advanced Resilient Architecture) is a decentralized system designed to improve **routing decisions, network resilience, and security** in mobile ad-hoc networks with minimal overhead. It is specifically engineered for **resource-constrained environments**, such as autonomous robot and drone swarms.

#### 🔍 Key Concepts Integrated
- 📡 **Routing Protocol Optimization**
- 🔁 **Efficient Information Dissemination**
- 🔐 **Network Integrity & Security**

The system autonomously adapts to dynamic conditions, mitigating attacks while preserving performance and energy efficiency.

#### 🚀 Core Features
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔄 Information Dissemination | SAHARA Sync uses lightweight diffusion to reduce overhead vs. traditional flooding |
| ⭐ Reputation-Based Evaluation | Nodes are assessed on trustworthiness to improve routing decisions |
| 🛡 Resilience to Attacks | Detects and responds to malicious activity (packet drop, DoS) ensuring performance recovery |
| 🤖 Self-Adapting System | Automatically adjusts to changing conditions to improve efficiency & security |
| 🧪 Simulation | Fully simulated using **NS-3** (discrete-event network simulator) |

#### 🛰 Use Case
Ideal for **swarm robotics and drone networks**, where resource efficiency, decentralized decision-making, and security are critical.

💡 Key benefits:
- 📈 Improved **routing robustness** via reputation-based decisions  
- 🔋 Reduced **communication and energy costs**  
- 🔒 Enhanced protection from **internal attacks on network integrity**
